"""A module for measuring the time it takes to close a GitHub issue or discussion.

This module provides functions for measuring the time it takes to close a GitHub issue
or discussion, as well as calculating stats describing the time to close for a list of issues.

Functions:
    measure_time_to_close(
        issue: Union[github3.issues.Issue, None],
        discussion: Union[dict, None]
    ) -> Union[timedelta, None]:
        Measure the time it takes to close an issue or discussion.
    get_stats_time_to_close(
        issues_with_metrics: List[IssueWithMetrics]
    ) -> Union[timedelta, None]:
        Calculate stats describing the time to close for a list of issues with metrics.
